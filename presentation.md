Agile
Agile is one of the methodologies. 
A large project is divided into several small parts. 
The work is performed by small teams that operate in short cycles. 
This allows you to evaluate the results of the work done, get feedback, and make changes to the product when new requirements are received.
The main features of Agile are:
- dividing issues into blocks
- autonomy and transparency
- daily standups
- feedback from users

Agile Flexibility
In traditional organizations, processes operate in a cascading model. Everything happens in stages. 
If the product requirements change, you have to do it all over again. 
You have to make a choice-develop a new plan or continue with the old non-working plan.
Agile methods are more flexible and are designed to deal with these problems. 
We can say that Agile is a set of different approaches to reduce possible risks.
Agile is based on the following principles:
- People are more important than things
- Documentation should not interfere with your work
- Cooperate, not re-read the contract
- Live, breathe, change as quickly as possible
 
 
General Agile practices

1. Working on mini-units
A large task is divided into blocks. 
They contain something valuable for the consumer or end user. 
Each block can be implemented in a short cycle, and you can see progress or lack of it.

2. Small cross-functional teams
Each team performs something valuable for the consumer. 
The size of teams varies from five to nine people.

3. Limiting the amount of work in progress
Teams focus on the amount of work that can be done in a short cycle.

4. The autonomy of teams.
At the beginning of each short cycle, a work plan is drawn up. 
Teams decide how to execute it. 
The company's management determines the basic rules, but the performers are free to choose the method of action.

5. Reaching the ready stage.
When Agile works correctly, the team performs its work fully and regularly by the end of each cycle. 
Splitting into mini-blocks allows teams to bring the task to the "ready" state, but not "almost completed".

6. Continuous operation.
A priority goal is set for each short cycle. 
Teams do their work without being distracted by other tasks.

7. The use of boards with stickers.
Anyone could get to the workplace of employees and immediately find out the status of work and the source of potential problems.

8. Feedback from users on each cycle.
Based on this information, they evaluate their achievements and take this feedback into account when planning further steps. 

Scrum.
To implement a philosophy in life, you need rules, templates, and tools. 
They are called frameworks.
Let's look at how you can work with Agile using the example of Scrum. 
Today this is the most popular flexible method. 
Scrum is designed to cope with the disadvantages of classic project management.
Main components of Scrum

1. The product owner
He has a vision of what you are going to do and produce. 
The product owner considers the risks and benefits. 
He thinks what can be done and what will inspire you.

2. Team
The specialists in the team must have all the necessary skills. 
The team must bring the product owner's idea to life. 
The team should be small, from three to nine people — this is the gold standard of Scrum.

3. Scrum master
This is the person who monitors the progress of the project. 
The scrum master conducts all short meetings and helps the team remove obstacles that hinder it.

4. Product backlog
This is a list of all the requirements for the product and arranged by their priority. 
The backlog develops throughout the life of the product.
The product owner should talk to all interested parties and display the customer's requirements in the backlog.

5. Evaluating the product backlog
Team members need to calculate how much effort it will take to complete a task from the backlog. 
You don't need to rate backlog tasks in hours, because people are not good at it. Calculate in relative sizes: "small", "medium"," large", or in points for a simple task that has already been completed.
 
6. Sprint planning
This is a chance for the product owner and team to discuss their goals. 
Everyone should agree on the sprint goal. 
If the team has agreed on the number of tasks per sprint, you can no longer add new tasks. 
This is the Basic rule of Scrum. 
The team must work independently and complete what it promised the customer to do.

7. Work should be visible
The most common way to do this is to have a scrum Board with columns:
- Need to do, or backlog
- In work
- Done
Stickers are custom tasks that need to be completed. 
During execution, the command will move the stickers from one column to another.

8. Daily meetings
Meetings don't last more than fifteen minutes. 
Every day, the team and the scrum master meet and give answers to three questions.
- What did you do yesterday to help the team complete the sprint?
- What will you do today to help the team complete the sprint?
- What problems stand in the way of the team?

9. The sprint review
This is a meeting where the product owner, scrum master, team and customer, management, and potential consumers are present. 
The team demonstrates the finished product parts completed in a sprint.

10. Retrospective meeting (analysis of the past sprint)
After completing the sprint, everyone meets at a common table and discusses the sprint. 
What went well? 
What could have been done better? 
What can you do better in the next sprint? 
What can be improved?

The sprint ends and the team moves on to the next sprint. This is how Agile works on the example of Scrum.
